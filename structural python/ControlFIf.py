# the first control flow we learn is the if statement
human = True
if human:
    print("Hey you are a human")
else:
    print("What are you?")
#The if statement has a variation elif which allows for introducing a condition after the pioneer one

animal = "Cat"
if animal=="Cat":
    print("What's new pussy cat")
elif animal=="Dog":
    print("this dog is very savage")
else:
    print("I don't know what animal you are")
#This is related to the control flow if else elif bye!
